Type Casting:
Type casting is converting the type of data from one date to another one.
We have two types of type casting. 
1). Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
2). Implicit/Widening/Automatic
When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/Narrowing/manual
when we go from a smaller data type to a large we call it Implicit/Widening/Automatic.
Byte-(8) Short-(16) Char-(16) Int-(32) Long-(64) Float-(32) Double-(64)
Byte->Short->,Char->Int->Long->Float->Double
Why do we need type casting?
-When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types. When we are working with math
sometime we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in non-decimal part.
What is the syntax?
Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
	int box=1000;
	byte box2=(byte) box;
Implicit/Widening/Automatic

short box1=250;
int box2=box1;

if statements:
	if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition and provided data.
	if condition
	if else condition
	if else if condition
	nested if else condition
why we should learn about if else condition?
	when we are solving real life problems
	like testing a web site our programs needs to make a lot of decisions.
what is snytax of if else conditions?
if condition

boolean rich=true;
	if(rich)
	{
	System.out.println("Lets buy a jet or island)
